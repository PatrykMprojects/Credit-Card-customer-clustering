# Credit Card customer clustering
This case requires developing a customer segmentation to define a marketing strategy. The
sample Dataset summarizes the usage behaviour of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The algorithms used in this project 
includes Kmeans and Agglomerative Clustering.
